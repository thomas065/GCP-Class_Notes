# GCP Class & Lab Notes

This repository contains my personal notes, hands-on exercises, and setup steps as I transition into Google Cloud Platform (GCP), with a focus on cloud security and infrastructure. It includes:

- Step-by-step lab guides using **Terraform**, **GCP VMs**, **firewall rules**, and **remote backend configuration**
- Networking concepts like **CIDR notation**, **VPC/subnet structure**, and **firewall design**
- Real-world scenarios for **multi-region VM access**, **RDP sessions**, and **ICMP communication**
- Security best practices (like avoiding the default network) and platform-specific tooling like **Kubernetes**

These notes are part of my learning journey as I prepare for GCP certifications and move from Power Platform development into a career in **Google Cloud Security Engineering**.
